## window manager


Efficiently move around windows in Windows using the stack just like browser's back and forth function

Hold `LEFT CTRL` and use `.` or `,` to flash back and forth in the history window, release when "," or ".", flash back to the start window.

Hold `LEFT CTRL + LEFT SHIFT` and use `.` or `,` to move back and forth from the history window, when `SHIFT` is released, the foreground window will go to the latest history window.

Moving any window foreground (excluding ignore programs defined in config.json) will add this window to the latest history window.
